# Codestrata CLI 🏛️

A geological-themed Git CLI that transforms your version control experience. Instead of git commands, use intuitive geological terms to manage your code layers!

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g codestrata-cli
```

## Commands

| Codestrata Command | Git Equivalent | Description |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `strata create-vault` | `git init` | Initialize a new repository |
| `strata excavate` | `git status` | Check repository status |
| `strata fossilize "message"` | `git commit` | Save changes with a message |
| `strata stratum-shift branch-name` | `git branch` | Create a new code layer (branch) |
| `strata connect-vault origin url` | `git remote add` | Connect to a remote repository |
| `strata uplift origin main` | `git push` | Push changes to remote |
| `strata unearth [remote]` | `git fetch` | Fetch changes from remote |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new repository
strata create-vault

# Check status
strata excavate

# Commit changes
strata fossilize "Initial rock formation"

# Create a new branch
strata stratum-shift feature-layer

# Connect to GitHub
strata connect-vault origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Push your changes
strata uplift origin main
```

## Why Geological Terms?

Just as geologists study Earth's history through rock layers, developers manage code through layers of changes:
- Commits become "fossils" - preserved snapshots of your code
- Branches become "strata" - different layers of development
- Status checks become "excavations" - examining your current state
- Pushing becomes "uplift" - elevating your code to remote repositories

## Command Details

### create-vault
Initializes a new git repository:
```bash
strata create-vault
```

### excavate
Shows the current status of your repository:
```bash
strata excavate
```

### fossilize
Creates a commit with your changes:
```bash
strata fossilize "Add new feature layer"
```

### stratum-shift
Creates a new branch:
```bash
strata stratum-shift feature-name
```

### connect-vault
Connects to a remote repository:
```bash
strata connect-vault origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### uplift
Pushes changes to the remote repository:
```bash
strata uplift origin main
```

### unearth
Fetches changes from the remote repository:
```bash
strata unearth
# or
strata unearth origin
```

## Requirements
- Node.js >=14.0.0
- Git installed and available in PATH
